### Pythone version 3 required!

This is my childhood game made with python and Tkinter library

Launch the game using terminal or cmd by running:

`python3 main_game_gui.py` or `python main_game_gui.py`

After game launched you should see this window:

Choose the sign you want to play with against computer and press ` Žaidžiam!`

After that you will see if you won lost or it's a tie game.
